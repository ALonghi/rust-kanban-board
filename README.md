# Kanban board project

This project was just created for experimenting with Rust

## How to run

### Run the backend

You need to first setup a `.env` file in the `server` folder and specify the MONGO_URI environment variable.
Then you may run:

```bash
cd server
cargo run
```

### Run the frontend
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```
